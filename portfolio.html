				<h2>RelayFX Desktop Application</h2>
				<p>
					<img class="portfolio-image" src="image/Relay App.JPG"/>
					This application back-end is written in Java and its front-end is written in FXML using the JavaFX technology. It is a control solution designed to control target device remotely via a bluetooth or zigbee serial transreceiver module connected to the operational desktop computer via USB.
					The target device shall have an embedded board as an intermediary between its transreceiver and the device control switch board. If your embedded board is an arduino, You can as well download the arduino code for this project <a href="#arduinoRelayFX-code">here</a>. You are free to download this code, study and edit to suit you. The operational PC must run JRE 1.8 or above.

				<h2>Fingerprint Attendance App </h2>
				<p>
					<img class="portfolio-image" src="image/Fingerprint.JPG"/>
					This application is written in Java using the swing technology. It is developed to basically solve proxy attendance taking in any institution. The application is designed to use only digital personna USB fingerprint hardware. The application uses JDBC to interract with localhost MySQL database to store enrolled candidates data. You as an administrator can enroll two fingers for each candidate, such candidate can use either of the finger to take his/her attendance for the day. It tabulate the attendance for that day  upon query. You are free to download this code, study and edit to suit you. The user name and password is <b>gateway</b>.
