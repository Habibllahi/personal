              Development of REST microservices for a mini-grid management. Having served as utility manager at Rubitec 
              Gbamugbamu Microservices, I realised some challenges and took a confident step of writting server side solution
              for the problem as REST microservices. The project named "MMS" is developed to solve challenges of persisting data in to cloud.
              Resources such as shutdown, expenditure, generator runtime, site, operator, vendor e.t.c were created and endpoints were provided for client side to 
              consume. Client can then download data in CSV format. This software makes it easy for the utility manager to persist record using 
              mobile app or web app and be rest assured the headquater have access to it instantly or anytime needed. The project has service layer that performs some
              logics with the data before persisting. The program also send email notifications as necessary to all registered recipients of the operator.
              The project is developed using Java with Spring framework, lombok, Hibernate, Jackson, Kubernate etc.

              I coordinate the sales of power as well. My responsibility include
              solving problem as fast as possible to minimize down time. In the

            <p class="project-desc">
              This code is written in C++. It is an embedded program designed to
              control the switching of the home appliances by the home user
              using Infrared remote control. The program is compactible with AVR
              microcontrollers. The microcontroller running this program
              receives signals from the IR receiver connected to it, analyse the
              signal and use the result to decide which appliance it's to ON or
              OFF, it simply ignore any signal that is not predefined in the
              program. You are free to download this code, study and edit to
              suit you.
